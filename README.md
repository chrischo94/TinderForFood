# TinderForFood

## Description:
When we don't have time, and don't have any patience, what we need is a way to make the one of the hardest decisions of the day, "What should we have for dinner?"  This application helps resolve this issue by simplifying the process and the final decision making.  With just a few swipes left or right, we can narrow down our choices that fit our tastes in that very moment.
